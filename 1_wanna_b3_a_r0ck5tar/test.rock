Rocknroll is right              
Silence is wrong                
A guitar is a six-string (initialise the_wolf = 136)       
Tommy's been down(initialise the_wolf = 44)
Music is a billboard-burning razzmatazz!(initialise the_wolf = 1970)

Listen to the music             
If the music is a guitar                  
Say "Keep on rocking!"                
Listen to the rhythm
If the rhythm without Music is nothing
Tommy is rockin guitar
Shout Tommy                  
Music is amazing sensation 
Jamming is awesome presence
Scream Music                   
Scream Jamming                 
Tommy is playing rock           
Scream Tommy       
They are dazzled audiences                  
Shout it
Rock is electric heaven                     
Scream it
Tommy is jukebox god            
Say it                                     
Break it down
Shout "Bring on the rock!"
Else Whisper "That ain't it, Chief"                 
Break it down
